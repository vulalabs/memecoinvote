# Solana Token List Voting App

This project is a web application that allows users to view and vote on Solana tokens. It fetches token data from the Jupiter API and uses Firebase for real-time vote tracking.

## Features

- Display a list of Solana tokens with their logos and addresses
- Allow users to like or dislike tokens
- Real-time updating of vote counts
- Search functionality to filter tokens by name or address
- Mobile-friendly responsive design

## How It Works

1. The app fetches token data from the Jupiter API.
2. Vote counts are stored and updated in real-time using Firebase Firestore.
3. Users can like or dislike tokens, with the changes reflected immediately.
4. The token list is sortable by vote count and searchable by token name or address.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Configuration

To run this project, you'll need to set up a Firebase project and add your configuration to a `.env.local` file. The file should contain the following variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

Replace the values with your actual Firebase configuration.
